    "This code takes a pattern and a string.Recursively, it traverses the string.Adds each letter,which is traversed, to the s2 array. The s2 array will be deleted and the next letter will be added to the s2 , if the s2 array represents a pattern.The function keeps to traverse string until there is no letter in the string.After traversing is done ,if the length of s2 equals to zero ,the function returns True.Otherwise it return False."
